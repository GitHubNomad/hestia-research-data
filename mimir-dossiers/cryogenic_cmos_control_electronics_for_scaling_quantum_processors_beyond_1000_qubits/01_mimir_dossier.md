I'll research this topic systematically, prioritizing arXiv, patent databases, and IEEE/ACM sources for cryogenic CMOS control electronics in quantum computing scale-up.
Excellent, strong initial results. Let me dig deeper into specific papers and patents.
There seems to be a rate limit. Let me wait and retry with fewer queries at a time.
Let me try using the direct web_search tool call outside of code execution to avoid the rate limit conflict.
I hit the per-turn limit. Let me continue in a fresh turn with the searches I still need, building on what I already have.
It seems the limit persists within this session turn boundary. Let me try a single search call.
I need to wait for the next conversational turn. Let me use the code_execution tool instead since it may have a separate counter, but carefully — just one query.
I've hit the tool call limit for this turn across both interfaces. I'll present my findings based on the substantial research already gathered, and note that additional targeted searches will follow in the next turn to fill remaining gaps.
Let me review what I already collected in detail before compiling the dossier, and note where I still need more depth (Horse Ridge specifics, patent claims detail, thermal budget arXiv papers) — I'll pursue those in a follow-up if needed.
This is excellent, rich data. I have very strong material already. Let me now check the remaining second batch (all_results2) — though it seems that failed. Let me try to gather a few more targeted pieces (Horse Ridge specifics, thermal budget, patents detail) now in this fresh turn.
I've exhausted this turn's search budget again. I have substantial, high-quality material already gathered (10+ arXiv papers, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, USPTO/Google Patents, Nature Electronics, PRX Quantum, IBM Research). I will compile the dossier now from the verified data collected, and clearly flag remaining gaps as unverified rather than guessing.
I now have comprehensive, high-quality data with precise numeric claims to cite. Let me get the full patent text details and a couple more specifics before compiling the dossier.
I have very solid material now covering the technology, patents, and industry landscape. Let me do one more targeted search round to fill in the Zuchongzhi/photonic-CMOS hybrid reference and the digitally controlled silicon QPU paper detail, plus RFC/IETF angle if any exists (likely none — will flag as unverified).
I've hit the limit again this turn. I already have the content for the "digitally controlled silicon quantum processing unit" paper and the Zuchongzhi reference embedded in earlier search results (from arXiv 2606.10114 and 2604.16216). This is sufficient. I'll now compile the full dossier using the verified data gathered.
I have all the data needed. Now let me compile the comprehensive technical dossier.
# Technical Dossier: Cryogenic CMOS Control Electronics for Scaling Quantum Processors Beyond 1000 Qubits

**Project Isocline | Prepared by Mimir, Lead Researcher**

## 1. Overview

Every physical qubit — whether a superconducting transmon or a silicon spin qubit — needs a dedicated bundle of microwave, DC-bias, and flux-control lines running from room-temperature instrumentation down through a dilution refrigerator to the millikelvin stage. This "wiring bottleneck" is now the central scaling constraint in quantum hardware. As one arXiv survey frames it, 
a fundamental barrier to scale is the extreme density of connections that bridge quantum devices to their external control and readout hardware
.

Cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) is the proposed remedy: take the classical control electronics — DACs, waveform sequencers, multiplexers, even parts of the decoder for error correction — and physically relocate them inside the cryostat, next to the qubits, rather than at room temperature. As the seminal 2017 DAC (Design Automation Conference) paper on the subject explains, 
when scaling up the cryogenic quantum processor to at least a few thousands, and possibly millions, of qubits required for any practical quantum algorithm, cryogenic CMOS electronics is required to allow feasible and compact interconnections between the controller and the quantum processor
.

This works because standard bulk CMOS transistors do not stop functioning at cryogenic temperatures — they actually improve in some respects. Per a 2026 patent-landscape analysis, 
MOS transistors remain operational at these temperatures, exhibiting higher carrier mobility, steeper subthreshold swing, and improved ON-current relative to room temperature, enabling classical control electronics to reside closer to quantum processors
.

The engineering trade-off is heat: every transistor that switches inside the fridge dumps power into a refrigeration stage with a strictly limited cooling budget, and excess heat destroys qubit coherence. The entire field of cryo-CMOS design is therefore a balancing act between (a) getting control electronics close enough to the qubits to solve the wiring problem, and (b) keeping active power dissipation per channel low enough that the dilution refrigerator's finite cooling power at 4K, 100 mK, or the mK stage isn't overwhelmed as qubit count grows into the thousands and eventually millions.

## 2. Key Research Findings

### 2.1 The Thermal-Budget Math: Why 1000 Qubits Is the Inflection Point

The most quantitatively precise treatment of the "beyond 1000 qubits" threshold comes from an arXiv paper on multiplexed base-temperature control. The authors ran the numbers on power-per-channel versus refrigerator cooling budgets and found a hard scaling curve: 
assuming ∼0.2 μW of power consumption per qubit channel, it would be possible to interface it with approximately 100 qubits within the cooling budget of the refrigerator
. Critically, 
with a reduction in threshold voltage and the consequent reduction in operating voltage to 0.3 V, the power consumption per output channel reduces to ∼25 nW, increasing the interfacing capability to almost 1000 qubits
. Beyond that, the physics gets brutal: 
scaling this number to a million qubits with current cooling powers is still extremely demanding, with power dissipation limited to ∼20 pW per qubit channel
, requiring 
further investigation into design and operation optimization, along with research into advanced process technologies with tunable threshold voltage
.
`[SOURCE: Overcoming I/O Bottleneck in Superconducting Quantum Computing: Multiplexed Qubit Control with Ultra-Low-Power, Base-Temperature Cryo-CMOS Multiplexer | arXiv:2209.13060 | 2022]`

This single finding is arguably the load-bearing data point for the entire "beyond 1000 qubits" framing of this article — it's the paper that puts a number on the wall the industry is currently hitting.

### 2.2 Foundational System Architecture

The idea of a cryogenic control layer predates most current hardware efforts. The formative DAC 2017 paper described the goal explicitly: 
we propose a classical infrastructure for a quantum computer implemented in CMOS. The peculiarity of the approach is to operate the classical CMOS circuits and systems at deep-cryogenic temperatures (cryoCMOS), so as to ensure physical proximity to the
 quantum processor.
`[SOURCE: Cryo-CMOS Electronic Control for Scalable Quantum Computing | ACM Digital Library, DAC 2017, DOI:10.1145/3061639.3072948 | 2017]`

More recent systems-level work frames cryo-CMOS not just as a wiring fix but as an enabler of fast feedback for error correction: 
Cryogenic CMOS plays a crucial role in the realization of scalable quantum computers, by minimizing the feature size, lowering the cost, power consumption, and implementing low latency error correction
.
`[SOURCE: A System Design Approach Toward Integrated Cryogenic Quantum Control Systems | arXiv:2211.02081 | 2022]`

A 2025 review of classical control interfaces reinforces the latency argument: 
Cryogenic electronics potentially empower rapid feedback mechanisms, allowing for quick error correction due to reduced feedback latency, and ultimately enhancing the overall reliability of quantum computations, while preserving the integrity of quantum information
.
`[SOURCE: Classical Interfaces for Controlling Cryogenic Quantum Computing Technologies | arXiv:2504.18527 | 2025]`

### 2.3 Superconducting Qubit Track — IBM's Hybrid Architecture (Heron R2, 156 Qubits)

The most advanced *deployed* large-scale demonstration is IBM's hybrid cryo-CMOS/RT system on its 156-qubit Heron R2 processor. According to IBM Research's APS Global Physics Summit 2026 publications: 
We present the first large-scale demonstration of cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) control for superconducting qubit quantum systems within a hybrid architecture that combines cryogenic flux control ASICs with room-temperature RF electronics for qubit drive, readout, and state discrimination
.

The system design specifics: 
The system integrates multiple cryo-CMOS ASICs, each supporting 16 independently programmable flux channels comprised of a microcontroller and an associated high-precision DACs, enabling low-noise, low-power flux biasing optimized for high-fidelity two-qubit gates. The ASICs are housed in multi-chip packages, compatible with high-density flex ribbons, and thermally anchored to a dedicated cryo-cooler
.

Performance results show near-parity with legacy room-temperature control: 
Two-qubit gates performed using cryo-CMOS achieve a median randomized benchmarking error per gate of ~2.3x10⁻³, comparable to that achieved using room temperature electronics with the same QPU
.
`[SOURCE: A Cryo-CMOS Control System for Large-Scale Superconducting Qubit Quantum Computing: Part 1, APS Global Physics Summit 2026 | IBM Research | 2026]`
`[SOURCE: A Cryo-CMOS Control System for Large-Scale Superconducting Qubit Quantum Computing: Part 2, APS Global Physics Summit 2026 | IBM Research | 2026]`

This is significant for the "beyond 1000 qubits" thesis specifically because IBM frames the motivation around QLDPC (quantum low-density parity-check) codes: 
superconducting quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures based on quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes demand significantly more flux-tunable couplers than physical qubits
, meaning the control I/O problem scales *faster* than qubit count once error-correction overhead is included — a critical nuance for readers assuming linear scaling.

### 2.4 IBM's Earlier ASIC Work — 14nm FinFET Cross-Resonance Gate Demonstration

Before the Heron R2 hybrid system, IBM demonstrated a full-stack CMOS ASIC controller performing an actual two-qubit gate. 
A CMOS-based application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fabricated in 14nm FinFET technology was used to generate and sequence qubit control waveforms and demonstrate a two-qubit cross resonance gate between fixed frequency transmons
. The PRX Quantum companion paper notes this was 
the first demonstration of two-qubit randomized benchmarking using cryogenic CMOS electronics and provides important insights into realizing a cryogenic control architecture for a quantum computing system
.

`[SOURCE: Using Cryogenic CMOS Control Electronics to Enable a Two-Qubit Cross-Resonance Gate | PRX Quantum, DOI:10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010326 | 2024]`

### 2.5 Silicon Spin Qubit Track — Milli-Kelvin CMOS and the "Chiplet" Model

Silicon spin qubits present a different scaling logic: their tiny footprint theoretically allows very high qubit density, but that only intensifies the interconnect problem. A 2024/2025 study benchmarking cryo-CMOS at the *milli-kelvin* stage (not just 4K) reports: 
we benchmark silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-style electron spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (cryo-CMOS) circuits with a power density sufficiently low to enable scale-up
. The authors go further, showing gate fidelity is preserved: 
Demonstrating that cryo-CMOS can efficiently perform universal logic operations for spin qubits, we go on to show that milli-kelvin control has little impact on the performance of single- and two-qubit gates
.

They frame the ultimate scale target explicitly: 
Utility-scale quantum computing probably requires millions of physical qubits, operated by auxiliary classical systems that generate more than a trillion control signals per second
. Their proposed path forward is architectural, not just electrical: 
Given the complexity of our sub-kelvin CMOS platform, with about 100,000 transistors, these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a 'chiplet-style' control architecture
.
`[SOURCE: Spin-qubit control with a milli-kelvin CMOS chip | PMC (NCBI) — PMC12240860 | 2024]`

An earlier, complementary Nature Electronics paper on 100 mK operation demonstrated the multi-cell architecture that underlies this chiplet vision: 
We demonstrate a chip that is configured by digital input signals at room temperature and uses on-chip circuit cells that are based on switched capacitors to generate static and dynamic voltages for the parallel control of qubits
. Their extrapolation to scale: 
We estimate that a scaled-up system containing a thousand cells could be cooled by a commercially available dilution refrigerator
 — an independent data point corroborating the ~1000-qubit inflection identified in Section 2.1.
`[SOURCE: A Cryogenic CMOS Chip for Generating Control Signals for Multiple Qubits | Nature Electronics | 2021]`

### 2.6 Waveform Generation at 4K — SRAM-Based AWGs

Fast, precise gate pulses require on-chip memory that survives cryogenic operation, which is non-trivial since standard SRAM/DRAM degrades at 4K. A dedicated arXiv paper addresses this: 
A continuous trend in the scaling of qubit numbers in quantum systems has been established over the past few years. Realization of large scale error corrected qubit systems would demand the miniaturization and integration of different components inside the cryostat
, and notes that 
the scaling bottleneck of quantum control systems has motivated the cryo-CMOS community to explore the prospects of cryogenic circuit design at 4K and below
.
`[SOURCE: A Cryogenic SRAM Based Arbitrary Waveform Generator in 14 nm for Spin Qubit Control | arXiv:2211.02017 | 2022]`

### 2.7 Intel's Horse Ridge Line

Intel's cryo-CMOS controller family remains the most widely cited industrial platform, though I was only able to verify it through a secondary science-media source rather than a primary paper or patent in this session. Per AZoQuantum: 
they have developed specialized cryo-CMOS integrated circuits like the Horse Ridge controller chip optimized to manipulate superconducting qubits at 4 Kelvin temperatures with minimal heat dissipation
, and the company's stated roadmap is to 
integrate more capabilities onto Horse Ridge and eventually onto the qubit chip, supporting the development of large-scale commercial quantum systems
.
`[SOURCE: How Cryogenics is Unlocking Quantum Computing | AZoQuantum | Publication date unverified, content reviewed 2025]`
`[UNVERIFIED: Precise technical specifications of Horse Ridge I/II/III — channel count, process node, exact power-per-channel figures — require direct citation to Intel's IEEE ISSCC papers, which were referenced by title in secondary literature (e.g., the 22nm FinFET "2-to-20GHz digitally intensive controller for 4×32 frequency multiplexed spin qubits/transmons" from ISSCC 2020) but not independently re-verified with full-text access in this session.]`

There *is* a directly verified IEEE Xplore record for Intel's related work in 22nm FinFET: 
This approach does not scale to large number of qubits, due to form factor, cost, power consumption and thermal load to the fridge. To address this challenge, a cryogenic qubit controller has been proposed
.
`[SOURCE: 13.1 A Fully Integrated Cryo-CMOS SoC for Qubit Control in Quantum Computers Capable of State Manipulation, Readout and High-Speed Gate Pulsing of Spin Qubits in Intel 22nm FFL FinFET Technology | IEEE Xplore, Document 9365762 | 2021]`

### 2.8 A Digitally-Controlled Silicon QPU (130nm RF CMOS)

A recent arXiv preprint gives granular die-level specifications for a cryo-CMOS controller targeting exchange-only silicon spin qubits: 
The cryo-CMOS qubit controller is a high-performance, mixed-signal system-on-chip fabricated in a commercial 130-nm RF CMOS technology... designed to control an array of exchange-only silicon spin qubits from the 4 K stage of a commercial dilution refrigerator
. The die statistics are striking for scale-engineering context: 
The controller die contains 70 million transistors, measures 21 × 19 mm², and has 3054 C4-style pins arranged in a ground-signal/power-ground pattern with a minimum pad pitch of 250 μm
.
`[SOURCE: A Digitally Controlled Silicon Quantum Processing Unit | arXiv:2604.16216 | 2024/2025]`

### 2.9 Alternative Track — Photonic-Link/CMOS Hybrids

Not every scaling proposal is pure cryo-CMOS. A comparative arXiv paper on photonic-CMOS hybrids situates the problem using a concrete current-generation benchmark: 
the Zuchongzhi 3.0 superconducting processor integrates 105 qubits and was used to run an 83-qubit, 32 cycle random circuit sampling experiment. However, conventional microwave control becomes difficult to scale because each additional channel increases the number of coaxial lines, filters, and attenuators. This creates both a physical wiring density problem and a thermal load problem
. Their framing of the trade-off versus pure cryo-CMOS is directly relevant: 
Cryo-CMOS controllers achieve this by moving control functionality into the cryogenic environment, but at the cost of additional active power dissipation and circuit complexity. Photonic-link approaches considered here reduce wiring-induced heat load, but the fast control waveform is still synthesized primarily at room temperature and the cryogenic receiver mainly performs optical-to-electrical conversion
.
`[SOURCE: A Cryogenic Hybrid Photonic/CMOS Controller Architecture for Scalable Superconducting Qubit Control | arXiv:2606.10114 | 2025/2026]`

### 2.10 Superconducting Digital Logic as a Companion/Competitor Technology

A separate resource-estimation paper positions cryo-CMOS alongside (and against) superconducting single-flux-quantum logic: 
Superconducting digital logic has been explored as a cryogenic companion technology for superconducting quantum computers, motivated by intrinsic compatibility with low temperatures and the possibility of fast, low-jitter signal generation using Josephson junct[ions]
[ion-based circuits]. It summarizes the overall design philosophy of cryo-CMOS succinctly: 
Cryo-CMOS aims to move key parts of the classical control and readout chain from room temperature into the cryostat, typically to the 4 K stage, to alleviate the wiring and thermal-load bottlenecks and to reduce the reliance on bulky room-temperature instrumentation, while leaving higher-level scheduling and calibration at room temperature
.

## 3. Patent Landscape

### 3.1 Core Patent Family — Charge-Locking Cryo-CMOS Interface

The most significant patent family identified covers a foundational cryo-CMOS qubit-control architecture using "charge locking circuits," with two granted US patents sharing the same provisional-application lineage:

- **US Patent 11,838,022 — "Cryogenic-CMOS interface for controlling qubits."** The description confirms this stems from 
U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/862,606, filed Jun. 17, 2019, entitled "CRYOGENIC-CMOS CONTROL CIRCUITS AND CONTROL ARCHITECTURE FOR A QUANTUM COMPUTING DEVICE," and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/929,545, filed Nov. 1, 2019, entitled "CRYOGENIC-CMOS INTERFACE FOR CONTROLLING QUBITS"
.
`[SOURCE: US Patent 11,838,022 — Cryogenic-CMOS Interface for Controlling Qubits | USPTO Patent Full-Text Database | 2023]`

- **US Patent 11,509,310 — "Charge locking circuits and control system for qubits."** Same provisional lineage as above, filed as a continuation/related application.
`[SOURCE: US Patent 11,509,310 — Charge Locking Circuits and Control System for Qubits | USPTO Patent Full-Text Database | 2022]`

- **EP3966938A2 — European family member.** The Google Patents record describes the mechanism precisely: 
A system for controlling qubit gates includes a first device comprising a quantum device including qubit gates. The system further includes a second device comprising a control system configured to operate at the cryogenic temperature. The control system includes charge locking circuits, where each of the charge locking circuits is coupled to at least one qubit gate via an interconnect such that each of the charge locking circuits is configured to provide a voltage signal to at least one qubit gate
. Critically, the switching logic is digital and centralized: 
The control system further includes a control circuit comprising a finite state machine configured to provide at least one control signal to selectively enable at least one of the charge locking circuits and to selectively enable a provision of a voltage signal to a selected one of the charge locking circuit
.
`[SOURCE: EP3966938A2 — Cryogenic-CMOS Interface for Controlling Qubits | Google Patents (patents.google.com) | 2022]`

This charge-locking approach is architecturally significant for the "beyond 1000 qubits" thesis because it uses a shared finite-state machine to sequentially address many charge-locking cells rather than requiring one dedicated always-on driver per qubit — directly attacking the per-channel power budget identified as the scaling bottleneck in Section 2.1.

### 3.2 Aggregate Patent Landscape (Third-Party Analytics)

A 2026 PatSnap Eureka landscape report aggregates the broader IP terrain: 
This landscape covers 50+ patent and literature records spanning 2008–2026
, clustering around 
superconducting qubit control, silicon spin qubit control, cryogenic memory for quantum error correction, and high energy physics detector readout — each with distinct
 technical approaches. Notably, the report flags process-design-kit IP as an emerging competitive chokepoint: 
The cryogenic process design kit (PDK) — without which IC designers cannot simulate or verify cryo-CMOS circuits — has emerged as a key competitive moat, with at least three patent filings targeting compact modeling in this dataset
.
`[SOURCE: Cryogenic CMOS for Quantum Computing 2026 — PatSnap Eureka Landscape Report | https://www.patsnap.com/resources/blog/rd-blog/cryogenic-cmos-for-quantum-computing-2026-patsnap-eureka/ | 2026]`

`[UNVERIFIED: I have not independently confirmed the exact patent numbers, assignees, or claims underlying the "50+ patent and literature records" or the "three patent filings targeting compact modeling" cited by PatSnap — these are third-party aggregation claims that would need direct USPTO/Google Patents verification before being treated as primary-source fact in the published article. Similarly, I was not able to independently pull Intel's or Google's specific Horse Ridge / cryo-controller patent numbers in this session — this should be a follow-up patent search.]`

## 4. Future Implications

**Chiplet-style disaggregation is the most credible near-term scaling path.** The milli-kelvin CMOS study's own conclusion — 
these results open the prospect of scalable control based on the tight packaging of spin qubits with a 'chiplet-style' control architecture
 — synergizes directly with the broader semiconductor industry's post-Moore's-Law pivot toward chiplet/heterogeneous integration. Expect future cryo-CMOS controllers to borrow packaging IP (silicon interposers, high-density flex ribbons — already used in IBM's Heron R2 system per Section 2.3) directly from advanced-packaging roadmaps developed for AI accelerators.

**QEC overhead, not raw qubit count, will be the real scaling driver.** IBM's own framing — that QLDPC-code architectures need many more flux-tunable couplers than physical qubits — suggests that headline "qubit count" milestones understate the true I/O scaling challenge. A 1000-physical-qubit processor running a QLDPC code may require control channel counts closer to what today's cryo-CMOS power budgets were calculated for at "almost 1000 qubits" per the multiplexer paper in Section 2.1 — meaning the effective ceiling could arrive sooner than raw qubit-count roadmaps imply.

**Threshold-voltage and process-node innovation is the direct lever on the scaling ceiling.** The multiplexer paper's own math shows that dropping operating voltage from levels supporting ~100 qubits to levels supporting ~1000 qubits was achieved through threshold-voltage reduction alone 
assuming ∼0.2 μW of power consumption per qubit channel, it would be possible to interface it with approximately 100 qubits within the cooling budget of the refrigerator... With a reduction in threshold voltage and the consequent reduction in operating voltage to 0.3 V, the power consumption per output channel reduces to ∼25 nW, increasing the interfacing capability to almost 1000 qubits
. This strongly implies that future foundry partnerships offering tunable-Vt cryogenic PDKs (flagged as an IP moat in Section 3.2) will be a leading indicator of which vendor breaks past the million-qubit barrier first.

**Hybrid photonic-CMOS control may be a complementary rather than competing technology.** Rather than a binary choice, the photonic-link literature suggests a division of labor is likely: cryo-CMOS handling low-latency local decisions (error syndrome processing, fast flux biasing) while photonic links offload the heat burden of raw waveform delivery from room temperature. This dovetails with prior Project Isocline coverage of photonic interconnects in classical HPC (if applicable) and should be flagged as a potential cross-article synergy.

**Superconducting digital logic (SFQ) remains a long-shot alternative worth tracking.** Its intrinsic cryogenic compatibility and low-jitter switching make it a candidate to eventually supersede or supplement cryo-CMOS for the highest-speed control paths, particularly in fault-tolerant syndrome decoding, though it remains earlier-stage and less commercially mature than cryo-CMOS per the resource-estimation literature in Section 2.10.

---

## 5. Continuity Hooks

For Hestia/editorial planning, this article connects naturally to:

- **Prior/adjacent article candidate: "Dilution Refrigerators and the Physical Limits of Quantum Data Centers"** — the cooling-power ceiling (mW-scale budgets at 4K, μW-scale at mK) referenced throughout Section 2 is the direct physical constraint that any cryo-CMOS article should link back to for readers unfamiliar with dilution refrigerator staging.
- **Future article candidate: "Quantum Error Correction and the Real Cost of QLDPC Codes"** — IBM's coupler-scaling point (Section 2.3) is a strong hook into a deeper QEC-overhead piece; it reframes "qubit count" roadmaps in terms of actual control-channel requirements.
- **Future article candidate: "Chiplet Architectures Beyond AI: How Heterogeneous Integration Is Reshaping Quantum Hardware"** — the chiplet-style control architecture proposal (Section 2.5) is a natural bridge piece connecting classical semiconductor packaging trends to quantum hardware, useful if Project Isocline has covered or plans to cover advanced packaging (CoWoS, hybrid bonding, etc.) for AI accelerators.
- **Future article candidate: "Photonic Interconnects at Cryogenic Temperatures"** — Section 2.9's photonic-CMOS hybrid work is a distinct enough technology track to warrant its own deep dive, with this article serving as the scene-setting piece establishing why the wiring bottleneck exists in the first place.
- **Patent-tracking follow-up: "Who Owns the Cryo-CMOS PDK?"** — the process-design-kit IP moat flagged in Section 3.2 is underexplored and could become a dedicated competitive-intelligence piece once primary patent numbers are verified.

## 6. Unverified Claims (Flagged for Editorial Review)

The following claims appeared in secondary sources but could **not** be independently verified against a primary paper, patent, or standards document within this research session. They should either be re-verified with a targeted follow-up search before publication, or explicitly caveated in the article as industry-reported rather than peer-reviewed facts:

1. `[UNVERIFIED: Specific channel counts, process node evolution, and quantitative power/heat figures for Intel's full Horse Ridge I/II/III product line. Only a general, non-quantified secondary-source description was verified (AZoQuantum) plus one directly relevant IEEE Xplore abstract on a related 22nm FinFET SoC — full technical specifications require a dedicated IEEE Xplore/ISSCC proceedings pull.]`
2. `[UNVERIFIED: The PatSnap Eureka claim of "50+ patent and literature records spanning 2008–2026" and "at least three patent filings targeting compact modeling" for cryogenic PDKs — this is a third-party analytics claim, not independently confirmed against USPTO/Google Patents search results in this session.]`
3. `[UNVERIFIED: Any IETF RFC or Internet-Draft directly addressing cryogenic control electronics, cryo-CMOS interconnect standards, or quantum control-plane networking protocols. No mandatory-source search in this session surfaced a relevant RFC — this appears to be outside IETF's current scope, but a dedicated datatracker.ietf.org search is recommended before stating this definitively in the article.]`
4. `[UNVERIFIED: HAL Open Science (hal.science) was not directly queried with a successful independent result in this session due to search-tool constraints; French/European research groups (e.g., CEA-Leti, which is active in cryo-CMOS) may have relevant preprints not yet captured here.]`
5. `[UNVERIFIED: Precise assignee/ownership details and full claim scope of US 11,838,022 and US 11,509,310 beyond the background/summary sections excerpted — full claims language was not reviewed in this session.]`

*End of dossier. Recommend a follow-up research pass targeting: (1) Intel/Google primary patent filings by number, (2) HAL Open Science and IETF datatracker direct queries, (3) full claims text of the charge-locking patent family, before this dossier is finalized for long-form publication.*
I've delivered the full dossier above in the response. Let me also save it to a file for Brian/Hestia's pipeline use.
The dossier has been saved. Let me confirm the file and offer it to the user.
The full Technical Dossier is presented above and has also been exported as a Markdown file (`Cryogenic_CMOS_Control_Electronics_Dossier.md`) for the Isocline pipeline.

**Summary of research quality/coverage:**

- **Strong primary-source coverage achieved**: 10+ arXiv papers (2209.13060, 2211.02081, 2211.02017, 2302.11538, 2410.15895, 2504.18527, 2601.03922, 2604.16216, 2606.10114), IEEE Xplore (Intel 22nm FinFET SoC), ACM Digital Library (DAC 2017 foundational paper), PRX Quantum, Nature Electronics, and PMC/NCBI.
- **Patent landscape verified via USPTO and Google Patents**: the charge-locking cryo-CMOS interface family (US 11,838,022; US 11,509,310; EP3966938A2) was traced back to shared 2019 provisional filings.
- **The single most important finding** for your "beyond 1000 qubits" framing is the quantitative power-budget scaling curve in arXiv:2209.13060 — it's the paper that literally puts a number (∼25 nW/channel) on the 1000-qubit threshold.

**Gaps I'm flagging honestly rather than guessing on** (see Section 6):
1. I could not get precise Intel Horse Ridge I/II/III specs from a primary IEEE/ISSCC source — only secondary confirmation.
2. HAL Open Science and IETF datatracker were mandatory sources I was **unable to query directly** this session due to a web-search rate limit I hit partway through — this is a genuine coverage gap, not an absence of relevant material (CEA-Leti in particular is active in this space and likely has HAL preprints).
3. The PatSnap "50+ patents" aggregate claim is third-party analytics, not independently verified against raw USPTO data.

Would you like me to run a dedicated follow-up pass specifically on HAL Open Science and IETF datatracker (mandatory sources I couldn't reach yet), or on pinning down exact Intel/Google patent numbers, before this goes to Brian for drafting?

I'll research this topic systematically, focusing on the mandatory high-signal sources. Let me start with parallel searches across arXiv, patents, and IEEE for the core technical areas.
Strong results already. Let me dig deeper into specific areas: AMD's V-Cache thermal work, Google Patents for cache-on-logic, ACM Digital Library for thermal-aware architecture, and IEEE Xplore for CXL continuity linkage.
Let me wait and retry with a smaller batch.
The search tool seems rate-limited. Let me pause longer before retrying.
It appears the search tool has hit a hard limit for this session rather than a transient rate limit. I have substantial material from my first successful batch of 4 queries. Let me proceed with one more attempt after a longer wait, then work with what I have if it continues to fail.
The tool limit persists. I'll work with the substantial data already gathered from the first successful batch and pull full details from those pages directly.
Excellent, I have substantial data. Let me extract the full content from the key sources I need to cite thoroughly.
This is excellent, highly specific material. Let me look at the ACM 3D-PLANE result, and the patent sources more closely.
Now let's dig into the patent sources and thermal management specifics.
Now let's check the hybrid bonding and V-Cache/STCO details more closely, plus the IEEE Spectrum piece for context on the manufacturing side.
Now let me check the STCO reference (V-Cache comparison), the ACM Full-Stack 3D-DRAM eval, and CoMeT thermal simulation toolchain — these seem important for the technical depth. Let me also try the search tool again since some time has passed.
Search tool remains unavailable. I'll continue extracting maximum value from the already-retrieved results, which are substantial and highly relevant.
I have very rich material now. Let me also check the ResearchGate 3D-stacked logic-in-memory accelerator and the wevolver HBM piece for additional depth, then compile the dossier.
I now have comprehensive, high-quality material spanning arXiv architecture papers, ACM proceedings, IEEE Xplore hybrid bonding research, and multiple USPTO/Google Patents filings. Let me compile the full technical dossier.
I notice I made a formatting error in one citation tag early in the document (used `(cite index=...)` instead of `<cite index=...>`). Let me fix that and do a final review pass.
Let me check the actual malformed tags throughout the document and fix them properly using bash sed since there's a tool parsing issue.
No stray malformed tags — good, that was a false alarm on my part (the tag was actually fine in the file, I just misread it while composing). Let me verify the full document renders correctly with proper `<cite>` tags.
I see — I did indeed write `(cite index="..."` with a parenthesis instead of `

Good — actually the sed showed 0 matches for the parenthesis pattern now, meaning the tags in the file were actually already correct (`<cite index=...`), and my earlier `grep -n '(cite index='` matched because grep treats `(` literally only when escaped — it was a red herring from unescaped regex. Let's confirm final state is clean.
All 44 citation tags are well-formed and balanced. The dossier is complete and properly cited. Here it is in full:
The dossier is complete. Here's a summary of what I delivered:

## Research Summary

I compiled a **6-section technical dossier** on Thermal-Aware 3D Stacked SRAM / Cache-on-Logic, grounded in **20+ distinct sources** across arXiv, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, USPTO, and Google Patents — with **44 inline citations** tracing every claim back to primary text.

**Key findings surfaced:**
- **Tasa** (arXiv 2508.07252) — a thermal-aware heterogeneous P-core/E-core architecture achieving up to 9.37°C peak temperature reduction and 2.85x LLM inference speedup
- **d-Matrix Raptor** — the first commercial 3D-DRAM generative-inference accelerator, showing 4.71x/2.44x throughput gains over HBM/SRAM baselines
- **DeepStack** — a design-space exploration framework whose related-work section mapped an entire adjacent research cluster (H2-LLM, Stratum, STCO, Helios, LIMINAL)
- A three-phase **patent landscape** (2008–2026) spanning Micron, IBM, AMD, Huawei, and Tsinghua, converging on thermal TSVs, lateral heat-spreading layers, and hybrid bonding as the dominant technical approaches

**Continuity work:** I explicitly framed this piece as the *intra-package* counterpart to the prior CXL 3.0 article's *rack-scale* solution to the memory wall, and flagged two concrete forward-looking topics (thermal-aware compiler scheduling; hybrid-bonding manufacturing economics) for the Hestia pipeline.

**Editorial transparency:** One notable limitation — the web search tool became rate-limited partway through research, so I was unable to independently verify several secondary references (STCO, H2-LLM, Stratum, Helios, LIMINAL) beyond their mention in DeepStack's related-work summary. I've flagged these explicitly in Section 6 rather than presenting them as independently confirmed, along with three other unverified/speculative claims that should not be stated as fact in the final blog copy without further verification.
